			<!-- Body -->
			<div class="body">
				<p>Dear Mr. Sami,</p>
				<p class="just">
					Pursuant to the Universal Code of Internet Etiquette (UCIE) ยง 420.69,
					and under the authority vested in me by the High Court of Memes &
					Reels Republic, I, Mahbubur Rahman Khan, hereby serve you with this
					legal notice.
				</p>
				<p class="just">
					It has come to my attention that you have been persistently sending me
					reels that are, to put it mildly, visually unpleasant and
					cringe-worthy. These reels have caused me severe emotional distress,
					aesthetic trauma, and have significantly lowered the quality of my
					digital life.
				</p>
				<p class="just">
					Heretofore, you are hereby notified that your actions constitute a
					breach of the implied covenant of good taste and decency in online
					communications. The reels in question, including but not limited to
					dancing cats in tutus, awkward shit videos, and inexplicable
					slow-motion poisonous videos, have been deemed hazardous to my mental
					well-being and are in violation of the Digital Aesthetics Protection
					Act (DAPA) of 2023.
				</p>
				<p class="just">
					Furthermore, your actions have been found to be in contravention of
					the Geneva Convention on Digital Content, specifically Article 13,
					which prohibits the dissemination of content that could be classified
					as 'weapons of mass distraction.' An independent audit conducted by
					the Bureau of Internet Standards has rated the reels you sent as
					having a Cringe Factor of 9.5 out of 10, which is well above the
					acceptable threshold of 3.0.
				</p>
			</div>

			<!-- Demand -->
			<div class="demand">
				<p><strong>DEMAND:</strong></p>
				<p class="just">
					You are hereby demanded to immediately cease and desist from sending
					any further reels that fall under the categories of "cringe,"
					"visually unpleasant," or "aesthetically offensive." Additionally, you
					are required to provide compensation in the form of a lifetime
					assurance of not chanting APA's name, a written apology drafted in
					calligraphy to be delivered through a delicious treat from Kashundi
					(find anywhere in Bangladesh), and attendance at a mandatory course on
					'Aesthetic Appreciation in the Digital Age,' to be conducted via Zoom
					by a panel of renowned internet critics.
				</p>
			</div>

			<!-- Consequences -->
			<div class="consequences">
				<p><strong>CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE:</strong></p>
				<p class="just">
					Failure to comply with this notice within 7 days from the date of
					receipt will result in the following actions:
				</p>
				<ul class="just">
					<li>
						Initiation of a formal complaint with the International Court of
						Internet Etiquette (ICIE).
					</li>
					<li>
						Public shaming on all major social media platforms, including a
						dedicated hashtag campaign #SamiStopTheReels.
					</li>
					<li>
						A mandatory subscription to a daily newsletter of even more
						cringe-worthy content, as a form of poetic justice.
					</li>
					<li>
						Revocation of your internet privileges for a period of no less than
						30 days, during which time you will be restricted to using a dial-up
						connection and browsing only text-based websites, no porn sites as
						well.
					</li>
					<li>
						Relentless irritation by repeatedly reciting the name of Roxy in every conversation, meeting, or digital interaction,
						causing you to relive the horrors of romanticism.
					</li>
					<li>
						Orchestration of an arranged marriage between you and ousted PM Sheikh Hasina,
						with the full cooperation and enthusiastic support of your father,
						to be solemnized with a cringe-worthy reel montage of your past
						offenses.
					</li>
					<li>
						A permanent injunction prohibiting you from traveling to Chittagong,
						enforced by a blockade of memes and incessant notifications
						reminding you of your reel-related transgressions.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<!-- Closing -->
			<div class="closing">
				<p class="just">
					This notice is issued without prejudice to any other rights or
